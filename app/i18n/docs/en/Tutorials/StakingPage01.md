As you might understand already, staking and the tickets have three core functions. First and arguably the most important, is the validation of previous blocks.

Tickets that are selected are offered the ability to vote on the previous block's validity.  So, for example, if the previous block wasn't a version that you want to support or didn't contain any transaction a voter can vote against the block.  If the previous block receives a major of votes against it's validation, then all of the 'regular' are put back into the mempool and need to be mined again in a future block.  Also, the PoW miner of that block no longer receives their block creation reward.
