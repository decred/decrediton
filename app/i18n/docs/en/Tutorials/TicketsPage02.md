These tickets are used to vote on blocks that have been created by the Proof-of-Work (PoW) miners. These votes allow stakeholders to ensure that blocks are being created properly. Votes include the ability to vote for or against on-chain consensus changes. Finally, ticket ownership allows for participation in Decred's off-chain governance system Politeia, where users are able to submit proposals within the Decred eco-system.
