Tickets are used in a variety of different ways within the Decred ecosystem.  Firstly, as mentioned before, 5 tickets are selected for each block to vote on whether the previous block is valid.  The selected tickets also are given a chance to vote on any consensus vote that may be running at the time.  Thirdly, the owners of the tickets are able to vote on proposals submitted by the community (Politeia).  Lastly, stakeholders can vote on whether they approve monthly development expenditures.
