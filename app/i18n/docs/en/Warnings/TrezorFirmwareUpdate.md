**Warning!** Only use official firmware distributed by SatoshiLabs (Trezor
manufacturer) or other very trusted sources. Using a non standard firmware
or one obtained from an unreputable individual or company might result in **loss
or stealing of funds**.

Also, ensure you have access to your seed, that it is valid and that it
corresponds to the funds in this wallet. Firmware updates might cause all data
in the device to be wiped, requiring a recover operation afterwards.
