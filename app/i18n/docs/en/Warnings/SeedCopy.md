# Seed Clipboard Copy Warning

Please note that copying the seed to the clipboard may be a security risk, as other applications may be able to monitor and copy the contents of the clipboard.

It is also highly unadvised to maintain the seed on a computer file, especially without encryption, as that can lead to stealing of funds by anyone with access to the computer.

Further, storing the seed on a computer file without backing it up on a physical medium (written down piece of paper stored in a secure location) can cause loss of funds if the local wallet file gets corrupted or is otherwise unavailable (due to hardware failure or any other number of issues).

If you want to learn more about seed security, please check our seed FAQ located at https://docs.decred.org/faq/wallets-and-seeds/.

If you are sure you understand the risks and still want to copy the seed to the clipboard, please type the indicated phrase below in the box and the seed will be copied to the clipboard.
