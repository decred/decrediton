**Warning!** Please ensure you have the seed for your trezor device stored in a
secure and accessible location, that it is valid, and that it is the correct key
for this wallet before performing a device wipe and recovery.

Failure to do so will result in **loss of funds**.

Please also note that Decrediton only supports recovering 24 word (256 bit)
seeds and that the words for trezor and dcrwallet imports are *different*.
