You must use an already setup Ledger “Device Wallet”, a device already initialized with a seed and the decred app installed. New devices should be initialized via [ledger live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/) and the decred app downloaded and installed there.

A Ledger-backed wallet can be used with multiple cryptocurrencies without conflict. In other words, if you already use your device wallet with other coins, you can keep using it and use the same seed for your Decrediton wallet.
