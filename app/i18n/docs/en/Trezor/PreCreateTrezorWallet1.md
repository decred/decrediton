To setup your Trezor-backed Decrediton wallet, you may use an already setup Trezor “Device Wallet” (a device already initialized with a seed). New device can be initialized either at [https://trezor.io/start/](https://trezor.io/start/) or in the Device Setup tab.

A Trezor-backed wallet can be used with multiple cryptocurrencies without conflict. In other words, if you already use your device wallet with other coins, you can keep using it and use the same seed for your Decrediton wallet.
