Trezor wallets used within Decrediton do not currently support staking operations (purchasing, voting and revoking tickets). To track progress in regards to staking with Trezor devices, please see [issue #1491](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1491) and provide feedback on the current implementation of Trezor support in Decrediton so we can gauge interest for adding this feature.
