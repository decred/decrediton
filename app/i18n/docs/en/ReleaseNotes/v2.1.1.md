This release of Decrediton includes numerous improvements within both the
underlying daemon and wallet software.

* There is a new on-chain vote to upgrade the network and approve the new agenda,
  which fixes issues with regular development subidy spending. You can read
  about the implementation and the reasoning by the change in more detail 
  [here](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0013/dcp-0013.mediawiki).

* dcrdex is now at 1.0.4 and now includes new assets, improvements and
  bug fixes.  The more detailed release notes discussing those changes can be found
  [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/v1.0.4).

* Mixing/Privacy has been improved with changes to daemon and wallet software.  
  Ideally, these changes should help make mixes successful more often and improve
  the overall privacy of those mixes.  You can read more about those improvements
  in the dcrd and dcrwallet sections of the release notes found [here](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v2.1.0).
