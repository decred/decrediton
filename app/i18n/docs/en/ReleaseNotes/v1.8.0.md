This release of Decrediton includes numerous bug fixes and refinement across
all pages/tabs.

* All pages have had layouts and styling updated to match redesign specs. There
  are a few more pages that will receive design updates.  Trezor pages
  were recently updated and Ledger integration is currently on schedule and
  should be included in an upcoming release in the near future.

* DCRDEX is now at 0.6.1 and has included numerous improvements as well as new 
  assets to be able to trade.  There are most exciting updates in the future 
  for DCRDEX as laid out in the recently approved [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4d2324b).  

* Test coverage has also increased to cover most of the front end areas. 
  Hopefully, in a few more releases we'll have the entirity of Decrediton 
  covered with unit tests that should protect us from most regression errors.

* The ability to vote on all treasury spending is now active.  This can be 
  done by approving/dis-approving all treasury spending or spending can be voted
  on per transaction.  

* Legacy tickets and references to stakepool has been completely removed from
  the codebase.
