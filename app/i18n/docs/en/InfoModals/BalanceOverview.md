# Balance Information

**Total** This is the total balance controlled by this account currently.

**Spendable Balance** The spendable/accessible balance for the this account.

**Locked By Tickets** This is the balance that is currently locked by tickets for this account. Once the tickets are voted or revoked these funds will be unlocked.

**Voting Authority** This balance shows the total amount that this account has voting authority over.  For example, if you use a voting-only wallet this will show that total amount controlled.

**Immature Rewards** These are regular coinbase rewards that are currently maturing (from PoW mining reward for instance).

**Immature Stake Generation** This balance shows the current stake rewards and revocations that are awaiting maturity (256 blocks on mainnet)."

**Time-locked** Unlike the normal accounts that involve keys innately generated by the wallet itself, the Time-locked (or previously known as imported) account is set for scripts (such as VSP use for staking, voting) or imported private keys that can't be innately generated by the wallet.
