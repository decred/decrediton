If you receive an error about the script not being redeemable when attempting to add your stakepool, you can try the following:

  1. Each stakepool account you create can only be associated with 1 wallet. If you have previously created this stakepool account with a different wallet (different seed), then you must create a new account.

  2. If you had previously used a ‘voting account’, for your ticket purchases, please go to the Accounts page and create a new account. This may now allow you to successfully import your script for your stakepool.
