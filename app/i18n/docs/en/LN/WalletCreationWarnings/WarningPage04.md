A channel is opened by locking up an amount of DCR into an on-chain ‘funding transaction’. This automatically creates a 2 of 2 multisig wallet on the Decred network, with each user receiving one of the keys (usually requiring up to 6 confirmations (blocks) to be available.).

Off-chain Lightning Network transactions can be made with the confidence of on-chain enforceability, when a channel is closed its balance will then be recorded to the Decred blockchain.
