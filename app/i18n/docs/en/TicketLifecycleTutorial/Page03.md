Two things might happen next:

  A - Your ticket is mined into a block and it becomes an immature ticket. This state lasts for 256 blocks (about 20 hours). During this time, the ticket cannot vote and the ticket fee becomes non-refundable.

  B - If your ticket is not mined, it will stay in the mempool until the ticket price increases or the block height hits your ticket expiration date. At this point, both the Ticket Price and Ticket Fee are returned.
