When your ticket matures (256 blocks), it enters the Ticket Pool and can be selected to vote. For each new block, five tickets are deterministically and pseudorandomly selected to vote on the newly mined block. The average ticket is selected to vote in approximately 28 days, and any ticket has a 99.5% chance of voting within ~142 days. If, after this time a ticket has not voted, it expires and the original Ticket Price is refunded.
