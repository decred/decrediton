You must be connected to the network to cast a vote, which is why many people use stakepools. If your ticket is called and it misses the vote, you receive a refund on the original Ticket Price.

After a ticket has voted, missed, or expired, the funds (ticket price minus the fee) will enter immature status for another 256 blocks, after which they are released from lockup in the wallet. If a ticket is missed or expired, a ticket revocation transaction is submitted by the wallet to free up the locked ticket price.

NOTE: Revocations can only be submitted for a corresponding missed ticket. You cannot revoke a ticket until it is missed.
