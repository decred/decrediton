# What is a Wallet?

**Wallet is the tool for interacting with the blockchain and using Decred as a currency**. You can use it to send and receive DCR funds, as a personal ledger to record your transactions and to participate in the staking (PoS).

Wallets are deterministically generated by a seed key. The mnemonic seed is a list of **33 words** that can be easily written down on a piece of paper for backup.

**The seed works as a master key** that stores all of the information needed to re-create the wallet at any time  even if the encryption passphrase is forgotten or the wallet is destroyed. Same seed can also be used to export your wallet to other Decred wallet clients.

**Failure to keep your seed key private can result in the theft of your entire wallet. Under no circumstances should it ever be revealed to someone else.**
