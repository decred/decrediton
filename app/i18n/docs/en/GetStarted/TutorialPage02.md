# Key to Your Wallet

Wallets are deterministically generated by a wallet seed. The mnemonic **seed is a list of 33 words** that can be easily written down on a piece of paper for backup.

The seed works as a master key that stores all of the information needed to re-create the wallet at any time.

If the wallet encryption passphrase is forgotten or the wallet is destroyed (e.g. computer breaks), the seed can be used to recover the wallet. Same seed can also be used to export your wallet to other Decred wallet clients.

Failure to keep your seed key private can result in the theft of your entire wallet. Under no circumstanes should it ever be revealed to someone else.
