# Staking and Governance

Participation in Staking (PoS) is open to everyone and requires time-locking a portion of your DCR in return for tickets. The purpose of these tickets is twofold:

- Firstly they serve an automatic function of voting on the validity of new blocks.
- Secondly they grant the right to partake in the decision-making processes which determines the future of Decred.

The process of staking is essentially a lottery, where tickets are chosen to vote randomly. A successful vote returns the participant the original cost of the ticket and a part of the block reward as profit in newly created DCR.

In case the vote is missed (0.5% probability), the original cost of the ticket is safely returned without the reward. The average time for a ticket to vote is within 28 days and maximum up to 142 days.

**Staking encourages long term investment in Decred**. Participants are given a
real voice in the decision-making and are rewarded for engagement in the
project's governance.
