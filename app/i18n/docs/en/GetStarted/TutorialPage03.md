# Staking and Governance

Participation in staking (PoS) requires only existing Decred funds, _unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining that requires computing resources and electricity_.

Funds can be time-locked in return for tickets on the network. Tickets are chosen at random to vote on the validity of blocks. By average a ticket gets voted in 28 days _(with possible maximum time period is 142 days)_.

A successful vote returns the stakeholder a part of the Block Reward plus the original cost of the ticket. In case of missing the vote _(0.5% probability)_ the original cost of the ticket is safely returned to the user without the reward.

Changes are inevitable for all digital currencies, whether deciding on development matters or resolving unexpected problems. Decredâ€™s innovative governance system is built into the blockchain. This allows for seamless adaption to changes while keeping the existing blockchain ecosystem safe. The same tickets are also used as voting power when deciding on consensus changes.
