# Staking and Governance

Participation in Staking (PoS) requires stakeholders to time-lock a portion of their DCR in return for tickets. The function of these tickets is twofold:
- Firstly, they allow a staker to provide a check on miners by voting on the validity of blocks.
- Secondly, they grant the right to partake in the decision-making process which determines the future of Decred.

The process is essentially like a lottery, where tickets are chosen randomly. Once voted, the original cost of the ticket is unlocked and released, and a part of the blockreward is granted to the stakeholder.

By average a ticket gets voted in 28 days _(possible maximum time period is 142 days)_. A successful vote returns the stakeholder a part of the Block Reward plus the original cost of the ticket. In case of missing the vote _(0.5% probability), the original cost of the ticket is safely returned to the user without the reward.

Staking is open to anyone who owns DCR and encourages longterm investment in Decred by giving stakeholders decision making in project governance and rewards them for their participation.
