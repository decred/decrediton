# What is the Decred Blockchain?

**The blockchain is the heart of Decred**, where all activity that takes place is stored. It is like a global, decentralised spreadsheet or ledger that records all the activity that happens when Decred funds are transferred, keeping track of how many tokens are sent, and what the balance of every account is.

The blockchain is used to confirm that new transactions are valid and that no fraud is taking place.

Decred uses an innovative hybrid proof-of-work (PoW) proof-of-stake (PoS) for validating the transactions, keeping the network secure and making decisions on the consensus rules.

In return for participation, miners (PoW) and stakers (PoS) are rewarded with newly generated Decred tokens.
