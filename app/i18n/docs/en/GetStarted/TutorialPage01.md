# What is a Wallet?

**Wallet is the tool for interacting with the blockchain and using the currency.** It can be used to send and receive Decred funds, and acts as a personal ledger of transactions.

Decrediton Wallet can also be used for participating in staking (PoS) and project governance by time-locking your funds in return for tickets.
