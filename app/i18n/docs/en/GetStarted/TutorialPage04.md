# Safety Tips

Only you are responsible for your security.

Always keep your seed key and password safe. If you lose your seed key or password, nobody else can recover it.

Make a backup of your seed key and password. Do not store it on your computer, instead write it down or print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive.

Do not store your seed key in a cloud storage or a password service. If your account gets compromised, so may your funds.

Do not enter your seed key to any phising website. Nobody can reverse, cancel or refund transactions if your wallet has been compromised.

When something doesn’t seem right or you don’t understand it ask questions and do research. Avoid making a decision based on fear.
