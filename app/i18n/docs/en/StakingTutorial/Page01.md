Decred holders can participate in the Staking (Proof-of Stake) process by purchasing tickets. These tickets are used to vote on minersâ€™ Proof-of-Work in order to validate changes to the Decred blockchain, or on governance proposals within the Politeia system.

Staking to verify PoW is rewarding, as each cast vote receives part of the Decred Block Reward. Typically, five tickets are included in each block, meaning each ticket holder receives 6% of the total block reward.
