When a ticket is purchased, the cost of the ticket is locked in your wallet until the ticket is used to vote, or is revoked. Tickets enter the mempool, then the ticketpool where they are drawn at random to vote. There is a 99.5% probability that a ticket will vote. The average ticket will vote in 28 days, but tickets still in the pool that have not been drawn after 142 days will be revoked. The DCR used to purchase the ticket is released from lockup when it votes or when the ticket is revoked.

When a proposal is set for a vote in Politeia, a snapshot of the ticket pool will be taken at the time of voting. All tickets will have the right to vote on the proposal in an off chain process.

As block validation is immutable, decisions made on all voted tickets can be publicly tracked. Active participation in staking helps secure Decred networkâ€™s, network, ensure quality Proof-of-Work, and determine the future direction of Decred.
