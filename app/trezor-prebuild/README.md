This is used to contact trezor-bridge on a separate iframe in the wallet.

It is created by following the instructions at https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite and is the package in packages/connect-iframe. All binaries have been removed with `$ find ./ -type f -iname "*.bin" -exec rm {} \;`.

Current build is at commit 109db0a3f6fc6fc5cdb24098ee50480692c92dbf

TODO: Build this with webpack.
